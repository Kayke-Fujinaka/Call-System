## :page_facing_up: Explanation

The project was carried out using the framework [ReactJs](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) connecting with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) which helped with authentication, registration, login and data persistence.

üé≤ **How ‚Äã‚Äãthe Project Works**

It serves to establish a management routine available to the user, having some functionalities, such as, for example, creating a ticket, registering a company, editing ticket/customer information, editing the profile, etc.

The user can create clients or companies, which will be registered within the site, being able to create calls later.

If the user wants to register a call. He needs to put:

- Which customer needs this service. Thus, a list of some companies will appear;
- The subject that needs to be addressed or discussed;
- The status of the call, namely: In Open, In Progress or Answered;
- Complete that serves to better describe the problem, aiming to have a more effective communication (Optional).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**

The visitor will not have access to private routes. If you have not registered or logged in to the site. Therefore, whenever he tries to access the URL without being registered/logged in, he will be redirected to the homepage.

In addition, the user will not be able to return to the home page when already logged in. Thus, he will need to log out on the Profile page to return to the Login or Registration screen.

## üìÅ Pages

The site has a total of 5 pages, which are:

- **Login:** The page to login and access the site.
- **Registration:** The page that has the functionality to register users on the site and thus have access to other private pages.
- **Dashboard (Private):** The page that has the functionality to record tickets.
- **New Ticket (Private):** The page that has the function of adding a new ticket on the Dashboard.
- **Customers (Private):** The page that has the functionality to register a company, putting the company name, CPNJ and the company address.
- **Profile (Private):** The page that presents the information (name, email and avatar) of the registered user, which has the functionality to edit them, except for the email.
